This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This SPA was built as an exercise assignment for Simfy. It is a basic page that makes a call to The Cat Api
& outputs the result. To see it in your browser, follow the steps below.

First, make sure you have Node and NPM installed on your machine.

Next, clone this project by running the following in your terminal:
### `git clone https://github.com/mooniq/cats.git`

Once cloned, cd into the project directory and run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

The app will now be in development mode and you can 
open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
